  {
    title: "2. How We Use Your Information",

  {
    title: "3. Anonymization",
    body: "HedHunter AI is built on anonymized hiring. Before your profile reaches any employer, personal identifiers — name, contact details, photo, and other identifying information — are removed. Employers see only your skills, experience, and interview scores.",
  },
  {
    title: "4. Data Sharing",
    body: "We do not sell your personal data. We share anonymized profiles with employers on the platform. We use trusted third-party services (Firebase, AWS S3, Groq AI, Stripe) to operate the platform. These providers are bound by data processing agreements.",
  },
  {
    title: "5. Data Retention",
    body: "We retain your data while your account is active and for a reasonable period after deletion to comply with legal obligations. Interview audio is deleted immediately after transcription. You may request deletion of your account and data at any time.",

    title: "6. Your Rights",
    body: "You have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal data. To exercise these rights, contact us at privacy@hedhunterai.com. We will respond within 30 days.",

  {
    title: "7. Security",
    body: "We implement industry-standard security measures including encryption at rest and in transit, access controls, and regular security reviews. No system is 100% secure; we encourage you to use a strong password.",
  },
  {
    title: "8. Changes to This Policy",
    body: "We may update this policy from time to time. We will notify you of material changes via email or an in-app notice. Continued use of the platform after changes constitutes acceptance.",
